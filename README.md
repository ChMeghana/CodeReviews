# Code Repository Guidelines

This repository is intended for storing implementation code and facilitating structured code reviews within the team.

## Branching Strategy

- Each contributor must create a personal branch named using their full name or a consistent team convention (for example, `firstname-lastname`).
- For each topic or assignment, create a dedicated feature branch derived from your personal branch. 
- Ensure that the complete project for that topic is committed and pushed so that reviewers can pull, build, and run the code without additional setup.

## Submission Requirements

- Every topic-specific branch must include a Markdown documentation file (for example, `INSTRUCTIONS.md` or `README.md`) at the project root. 
- The documentation must clearly describe:
  - Prerequisites and environment setup.
  - Steps to build, run, and test the project.
  - Any additional notes required for effective code review. 

## Code Review Process

- Notify the reviewer once your topic branch is pushed and documentation is complete.
- Reviewers will pull the branch, follow the documented instructions, and provide feedback using the team’s agreed review channel (for example, pull request comments or review tools).
